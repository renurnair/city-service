This is a SpringBoot project created using Java 8 and built using Gradle 6.6.

Please import as a Gradle project or add Gradle nature to this project from Eclipse or similar IDE.

This project exposes an end-point to a RESTful service.
http://localhost:8080/connected?origin=city1&destination=city2

The service will respond with ‘yes’ if city1 is connected to city2,
’no’ if city1 is not connected to city2.
Any unexpected input will result in a ’no’ response.

The service determines if two cities are connected. Two cities are considered
connected if there’s a series of roads that can be traveled from one city
to another.

List of roads is available in a file - city.txt. The file contains a list of city
pairs (one pair per line, comma separated), which indicates that there’s a
road between those cities.
